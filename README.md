This repository contains the source-code of my iOS app _myMinigolf Board_. The main motivation for this app
was to learn SwiftUI and to make myself familiar with _Playgrounds_ on the iPad. The complete app was originally
written using _Playgrounds_ on an iPad. I even submitted the app using _Playgrounds_ for testing with _TestFlight_.
Later I migrated to _Xcode_ because of the missing localization feature in _Playgrounds_.
